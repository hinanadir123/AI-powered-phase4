# Tasks Breakdown: Phase 1 Todo Console App

## Overview
Generated actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for implementing the in-memory todo console application based on the available design artifacts (plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, research.md).

## Changes Made
- Created comprehensive tasks.md file with 52 individual tasks
- Organized tasks by user story in priority order
- Identified dependencies between user stories
- Provided parallel execution opportunities
- Aligned tasks with the implementation plan and feature specifications

## Technical Details
- Total task count: 52
- Setup phase: 2 tasks
- Foundational phase: 6 tasks
- User Story 1 (Add Task): 8 tasks
- User Story 2 (View Tasks): 6 tasks
- User Story 3 (Update Task): 8 tasks
- User Story 4 (Delete Task): 7 tasks
- User Story 5 (Mark Complete): 6 tasks
- User Story 6 (Error Handling): 6 tasks
- Polish phase: 3 tasks

## Validation
- All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Dependencies properly identified between user stories
- Parallel execution opportunities noted

## Outcome
The tasks.md file provides a clear, actionable roadmap for implementing the todo console app with each task specific enough for execution.

## Evaluation
The task breakdown successfully translates the design artifacts into executable tasks while maintaining proper organization and dependencies. Each user story has all needed tasks and can be independently tested.
