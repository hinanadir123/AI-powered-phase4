# Tasks Generation: Phase II Task CRUD Implementation

## Overview
Generated actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for implementing the Task CRUD functionality for the Phase II Todo full-stack web application.

## Changes Made
- Created comprehensive tasks.md file with 65 individual tasks
- Organized tasks by user story in priority order
- Identified dependencies between user stories
- Provided parallel execution opportunities
- Aligned tasks with the implementation plan and feature specifications

## Technical Details
- Total task count: 65
- Setup phase: 6 tasks
- Database Models phase: 5 tasks
- Authentication System phase: 6 tasks
- Task API Endpoints phase: 7 tasks
- Frontend Components phase: 6 tasks
- Frontend Integration phase: 6 tasks
- Polish phase: 6 tasks
- User Story phases: 13-25 tasks per story

## Validation
- All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Dependencies properly identified between user stories
- Parallel execution opportunities noted

## Outcome
The tasks.md file provides a clear, actionable roadmap for implementing the Task CRUD functionality.

## Evaluation
The task breakdown successfully translates the design artifacts into executable tasks while maintaining proper organization and dependencies. Each user story has all needed tasks and can be independently tested.
