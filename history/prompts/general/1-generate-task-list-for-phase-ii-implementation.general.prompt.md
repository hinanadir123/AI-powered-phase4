prompt_text: "$ARGUMENTS\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding\
  \ (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1\
  \ -Json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths\
  \ must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax:\
  \ e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load\
  \ design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack,\
  \ libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**:\
  \ data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions),\
  \ quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents.\
  \ Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n\
  \   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load\
  \ spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n  \
  \ - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/\
  \ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions\
  \ for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation\
  \ Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n\
  \   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness\
  \ (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate\
  \ tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n\
  \   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n\
  \   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n\
  \   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   -\
  \ Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested),\
  \ implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   -\
  \ All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n\
  \   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion\
  \ order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy\
  \ section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated\
  \ tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n\
  \   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each\
  \ story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation:\
  \ Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\
  \nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable\
  \ - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional\
  \ context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by\
  \ user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**:\
  \ Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or\
  \ if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task\
  \ MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description\
  \ with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start\
  \ with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002,\
  \ T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable\
  \ (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**:\
  \ REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc.\
  \ (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational\
  \ phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish\
  \ phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\
  \n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation\
  \ plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n\
  - ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n-\
  \ ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n\
  - ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001\
  \ [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model`\
  \ (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\
  \n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n\
  \   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related\
  \ components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services\
  \ needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests\
  \ requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories\
  \ should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint\
  \ → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract\
  \ test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n\
  \   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves\
  \ multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service\
  \ layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n\
  \   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking\
  \ tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that\
  \ story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n\
  - **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user\
  \ stories)\n - **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n \
  \ - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n\
  \   - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final\
  \ Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns"
response_text: "I've successfully created a comprehensive task list for the Phase\
  \ II implementation of the full-stack todo application. The tasks.md file contains:\n\
  \n1. **8 phases** organized by implementation priority:\n   - Phase 1: Setup and\
  \ Environment Configuration\n   - Phase 2: Backend Foundation\n   - Phase 3: Task\
  \ Management API (US1)\n   - Phase 4: Frontend API Integration (US2)\n   - Phase\
  \ 5: Authentication and Security (US3)\n   - Phase 6: User Experience and UI Polish\
  \ (US4)\n   - Phase 7: Testing and Validation\n   - Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting\
  \ Concerns\n\n2. **45 specific tasks** with clear IDs, descriptions, and file paths\n\
  \n3. **User story mapping** using [US1], [US2], [US3], [US4] labels\n\n4. **Parallelization\
  \ opportunities** marked with [P] where applicable\n\n5. **Dependency structure**\
  \ showing the order of implementation\n\n6. **MVP scope definition** focusing on\
  \ the minimum viable product\n\nAll tasks follow the required checklist format with\
  \ checkboxes, sequential IDs, and specific file paths, making them immediately executable.\
  \ The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each\
  \ user story."
