- **Redis**: Upstash (Free tier)

**Total Cost**: $0/month indefinitely

2. Migrate to Google Cloud ($300 for 90 days)
3. Migrate to Oracle Cloud (Always Free forever)

**Total Free Period**: 120 days + forever

### Strategy 3: Development vs Production

- **Development**: Local Minikube (free)
- **Staging**: Oracle Cloud Always Free
- **Production**: Azure/GCP with credits

### Strategy 4: Serverless First

Use serverless services that scale to zero:
- Neon DB (scales to zero when idle)
- Cloud Functions (pay per invocation)
- Cloud Run (pay per request)

### Strategy 5: Resource Scheduling

Stop resources when not in use:
- Stop VMs at night (save 50% costs)
- Scale down on weekends
- Use cluster autoscaling (scale to 1 node when idle)
